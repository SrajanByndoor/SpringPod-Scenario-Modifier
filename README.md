A sophisticated prompt engineering solution for educational content adaptation, enabling seamless transformation of business scenarios across different industries while preserving core learning objectives.

## Project Overview

The AI Scenario Modifier Tool is designed to address a critical challenge in educational content development: the need to adapt existing business case studies and scenarios for different industriesand learning environments while maintaining their instructional integrity. This tool employs  prompt engineering techniques to generate precise, context-aware instructions for AI language models, ensuring consistent and high-quality content modification outcomes.

## Core Problem Statement

Educational institutions and training organizations frequently encounter scenarios where excellent case studies exist for one industry but need adaptation for different contexts. Manual adaptation is time-intensive, often inconsistent, and requires subject matter expertise across multiple domains. This tool bridges that gap by providing a systematic and replicable approach to content transformation.

## Prompt Engineering Architecture

### Intelligent Prompt Construction

The tool's primary innovation lies in its sophisticated prompt engineering methodology:

**Structured Instruction Framework**: The system constructs multi-layered prompts that include context preservation rules, transformation guidelines and explicit preservation directives. Each prompt is dynamically assembled based on user specifications, ensuring optimal AI model performance.

**Rule-Based Content Preservation**: Advanced parsing logic identifies and categorizes different types of content within scenarios:
- Core learning objectives and principles
- Industry-specific terminology and examples
- Structural elements and narrative flow
- Specific phrases requiring exact preservation

**Context-Aware Transformation Logic**: The prompt engineering system includes intelligent context mapping that understands domain-specific transformations:
- Healthcare adaptations (patient care, regulatory compliance)
- Educational transformations (student engagement, academic processes)
- Technology sector modifications (development workflows, innovation cycles)

### Prompt Optimization Features

**Dynamic Rule Application**: Users can select from multiple content modification rules that are translated into specific AI instructions:
- Preserve Core Lessons: Maintains educational objectives unchanged
- Adapt Examples: Transforms industry-specific cases while preserving intent
- Keep Structure: Maintains paragraph organization and narrative flow
- Maintain Tone: Preserves formality level and writing style
- Update Terminology: Systematically replaces domain-specific language

**Granular Content Control**: The system allows users to specify exact text that must remain unchanged, implementing sophisticated string matching and preservation logic within the generated prompts.

**Iterative Refinement Support**: Generated prompts include meta-instructions for AI models to enable follow-up refinements and adjustments without losing context.

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

**Responsive HTML5 Interface**: Built with semantic HTML5 and modern CSS Grid layout, providing a professional two-column interface optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

**Progressive Enhancement**: The interface functions across all modern browsers with graceful degradation for older systems.

**Accessibility Compliance**: Implements WCAG 2.1 guidelines with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility.

### CSS Framework

**Custom Design System**: Utilizes a cohesive color palette aligned with Springpod branding guidelines:
- Primary navy (#2c3e50) for headers and primary elements
- Accent teal (#5dade2) for interactive components
- Complementary mint (#48c9b0) for secondary actions

**Typography**: Implements Poppins font family for optimal readability and modern aesthetic appeal.

**Responsive Grid System**: Two-column layout that adapts to:
- Desktop: Full two-column display
- Tablet: Optimized two-column layout
- Mobile: Single-column responsive stack

### JavaScript Architecture

**Modular Function Design**: Core functionality separated into discrete, testable modules:
- User interface management
- Prompt construction logic
- Rule processing and validation
- Content preservation parsing
- Output generation and formatting

**State Management**: Implements local state management for user selections, preserving session data without external dependencies.

**Event-Driven Architecture**: Utilizes modern event listeners and delegation patterns for optimal performance and maintainability.

## Prompt Generation Engine

### Advanced Text Processing

**Content Analysis**: The system analyzes input scenarios to identify key structural elements, terminology patterns, and learning components that require different handling during transformation.

**Rule Translation**: User-selected rules are converted into comprehensive instruction sets that guide AI models through specific transformation requirements.

**Preservation Logic**: Implements sophisticated parsing to ensure specified text segments remain unchanged while allowing contextual adaptation around them.

### Output Optimization

**Structured Formatting**: Generated prompts follow a consistent structure that maximizes AI model comprehension and response quality.

**Context Injection**: Automatically includes relevant context cues and examples to improve transformation accuracy.

**Quality Assurance Instructions**: Embedded quality checks within prompts to ensure output maintains educational value and readability.
